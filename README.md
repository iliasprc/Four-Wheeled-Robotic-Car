# Four-Wheeled Robotic Car Navigation using Computer Vision Techniques
## Project Overview
This project, conducted as part of the MEng Thesis in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Patras, showcases innovative applications of computer vision for autonomous navigation in a four-wheeled robotic car. The research primarily focuses on two key techniques: Line Following and Navigation with Aruco Markers. Through a combination of cutting-edge technology and advanced algorithms, this project demonstrates the feasibility of implementing real-time vision-based navigation in robotic systems.

## Line Folllowing
The Line Following module demonstrates the robot's ability to autonomously follow a predefined path. Utilizing sophisticated computer vision algorithms, the robot identifies and tracks lines on the ground, enabling it to maintain a steady course. This technology has wide-ranging applications in sectors like manufacturing, where automated vehicles can transport materials along designated routes with high precision and efficiency.
